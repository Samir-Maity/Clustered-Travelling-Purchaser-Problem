# Clustered-Travelling-Purchaser-Problem
# A CLustered TPP instnaces are given in file name: Clustered-Travelling-Purchaser-Problem_INSTANCES 
# The instnace Clustered-Travelling-Purchaser-Problem_INSTANCES contains 25 standard  TSP  problems with  Product costs (p_cost_file_INSTANCES NAME) and avalability (avl_file_INSTANCES NAME) are generated acording to Angelelli et al. 2011.
# Here a python code included in instnaces file Clustered-Travelling-Purchaser-Problem_INSTANCES with  file name: k-means-VLCGA_for_TPP_instances, The code contains specific informations like instance geneartions, k-means, VLCGA and results updtations are given. 
# A obtained results using k-menas-VLCGA are given in file(xlsx) name:Clustered_TPP_Result
# A file name :CPLEX_TPP contains solutions of the standard TPP using CPLEX by OPL with two name tpp_mod and TPP_Test, TPP_Test works for standard TPP instances given in Clustered-Travelling-Purchaser-Problem_INSTANCES as well as in given file: CapEuclideo.50.50.1.1_Test.dat; Other OPL file tpp_mod works for multi vehicle clustered TPP with multi items and different demand setting, for these purpose a data-set.txt file is included. The informations for different demand, avalabilty and prices are incuded in data-set.txt
# A  clustered TPP file name: Multi_Vehicle_Clustered-TPP  for multiple items are given  data set and a python code;   bays29.txt contain distance matrix, avalability by avl_multi_file.txt, product cots by p_cost_multi_file; A python code for multi vehicle clustered TPP:Multi-vehicle_Clustered_TPP_k-means-VLCGA.py 
# A  clustered TPP file name: Multi_Vehicle_Clustered-TPP-Single-item  for single items are given  data set and a python code:MVCLuTPP_Scenario-1.py , MVCLuTPP_Scenario-2.py
